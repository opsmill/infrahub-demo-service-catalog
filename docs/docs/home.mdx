## Getting started

To quickly get started, you can follow the steps below:
- Run through the [installation](getting-started/installation) guide.
- Then, you can run the demo by following the instructions in the [walkthrough](getting-started/walkthrough).

## The problem

Organizations aim to deliver services effectively, as this is where the money flows.

The stakes are high because the structure of a service dictates everything downstreamâ€”from invoicing and lifecycle management to resource allocation and capacity planning. A poorly designed service layer can result in inefficiencies and challenges at every stage.

The service catalog is the foundation of this structure, serving as a blueprint for how services are defined, managed, and delivered. It then becomes consumable by the organization to achieve infrastructure self-service.

## The solution

However, implementing a service catalog is a complex operation that many organizations struggle with. It demands a deep understanding of the product lifecycle, the interplay of various components, and coordination among numerous stakeholders. Beyond that, it requires a robust technical implementation to automate all the associated rules and processes properly.

In many ways, Infrahub is the perfect tool to support your service catalog implementation:
- **Flexible Schema**: Infrahub's schema can be tailored to fit the specific needs of your service catalog, allowing you to define services, components, and their relationships in a way that makes sense for your organization.
- **Version Control**: Infrahub's native version control capabilities enable you to track changes, ensuring that you have full visibility into the evolution of your network.
- **Generators**: Infrahub's generators can be used to codify the rules and processes associated with your service implementation, enabling fast and consistent implementation across the board.
- **Resource Managers**: Infrahub's resource managers can be used to automate the allocation and management of resources, ensuring robust and efficient resource management.
- **Branching**: Infrahub's branching capabilities allow you to isolate changes in a separate branch, paving the way for testing and validation before deploying changes to production.
