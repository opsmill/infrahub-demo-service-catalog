Before you can run the demo, you need to install the prerequisites and set up the environment.

<ReferenceLink title="Need help or have questions? Join our Discord community for support!" url="https://discord.gg/opsmill" openInNewTab/>

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure the following tools are installed:

- üê≥ **Docker**: Could be [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) on your laptop or any Docker endpoint on a VM.
- üêç **Poetry**: Install Poetry by following the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs).

## Steps

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the GitHub repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-service-catalog.git
cd infrahub-demo-service-catalog
```

### 2. Set environmental variables

These environment variables are used to connect to the Infrahub instance and authenticate API requests.

```shell
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN="06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec"
```

### 3. Install the dependencies

Our demos use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the Python environment.

```shell
poetry install
```

### 4. Start Infrahub

:::important

Make sure to start Infrahub using the following command to ensure the `service_catalog` module is loaded correctly! This will also start the Streamlit app for the service catalog.

```shell
poetry run invoke start
```

:::

### 5. Load schema and data into Infrahub

These commands will load the schema and data into Infrahub.

```shell
poetry run infrahubctl schema load schemas/ --wait 10
poetry run infrahubctl object load data/
```

### 6. Connect read-only repository

:::info

Infrahub can connect to external repositories to fetch scripts, templates, or other resources. Learn more about [git integration](https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/repository) in the Infrahub documentation.

:::

This command connects the demo repository as a read-only source.

```shell
poetry run infrahubctl repository add --ref main --read-only infrahub-demo https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-service-catalog.git
```

## Confirmation

üëâ Log in to [Infrahub UI](http://localhost:8000/login) on port `8000` with username `admin` and password `infrahub`.
üëâ You can connect to [Service Catalog](http://localhost:8501/) on port `8501`.

## Next steps

Now that you have set up the demo, you can explore the service catalog features and functionalities in the [walkthrough documentation](walkthrough).
